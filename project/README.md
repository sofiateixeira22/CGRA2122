## Project Notes

#### Point 1
- At this point, we had some difficulties in applying the texture. This happend because the texture was stretched instead of repeating itself.

#### Point 2
- At the point 2.5, we had some difficulties in creating the sides of the cylinder in MyCylinder.js.
- At the remaining points, we didn't have difficulties.

#### Point 5

- At this point, we didn't do the crane animation due to lack of time and not quite understanding how to do it.
- Despite not having the animation, we did the display of the crane.

- At this point, due to lack of time and after many tries, we couldn't implement the station to be on every point that represents a station without it being hard coded.
